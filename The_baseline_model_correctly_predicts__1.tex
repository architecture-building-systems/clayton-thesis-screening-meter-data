The baseline model correctly predicts the labels with a 18.1\% accuracy, while the features influenced models were 38.5\% for Non-Temporal, 45.3\% for the Temporal and 45.7\% for the combined model.  The baseline model represents common practice in which a class is chosen based on the probability distribution of that class occurring in the labeled dataset. The combined feature set more than doubles the probability of predicting this piece of meta-data.
