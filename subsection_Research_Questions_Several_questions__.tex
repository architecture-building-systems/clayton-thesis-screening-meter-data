\subsection{Research Questions}
Several questions are addressed in this work:
\begin{itemize}
\item How much information about a building can be predicted solely through the analysis of raw hourly or sub-hourly, whole building electrical meter data in the absence of conventional characteristic data? 
\end{itemize}
This question is dissected into more several more specific parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Which temporal features are most accurate in classifying the primary or secondary use types of a building?
\item Can temporal features be used to better benchmark buildings by signifying how \emph{well a building fits within its designated use-type class}?
\item Can temporal features be used to forecast whether an energy savings intervention measure will be successful or not?
\item What are the most appropriate parameter settings for various generalized temporal feature extraction techniques as applied to this context?
\item What is the speed of implementation and interpretability of such features across data from tens of thousands of buildings?
\end{itemize}
