\subsection{Research Questions}
Several questions are addressed in this work:
\begin{itemize}
\item How much information about a building can be predicted solely through the analysis of raw hourly or sub-hourly, whole building electrical meter data in the absence of conventional characteristic data? 
\end{itemize}
This question is dissected into more several more specific parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Which temporal features are most accurate in classifying the primary or secondary use types of a building?
\item Can temporal features be used to better benchmark buildings through
\item What are the most appropriate parameter settings for various generalized temporal mining techniques as applied to this context?
\end{itemize}
