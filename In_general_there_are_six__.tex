In general, there are six main motif candidates with two candidates appearing to be typical weekday types, two holiday or half-capacity types, and two weekend unoccupied types. Pattern $aaaa$ and $abaa$ are predominantly flat profiles common to non-occupied cooling consumption. Patterns $abba$ and $acba$ are representative of days in which school is out of session but the office spaces are still occupied by staff. Pattern $acca$ represents a standard full-occupied school day and it is by far the most common with 202 days tagged out of 474. Pattern $accb$ is similar to $acca$ with slightly more use in the late afternoon and early evening. This phenomenon is due to extracurricular activities planned outside the normal operating schedule of the facility.

For the purposes of characterization, a metric is developed from the \emph{DayFilter} process that approximates the presence of motifs and discords. This metric is a daily frequency calculation of each day's pattern count versus the total number of days. An example of this metric is seen in Figure \ref{fig:dayfilter_single}.
