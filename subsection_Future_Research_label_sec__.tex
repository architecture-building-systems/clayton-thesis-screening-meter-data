\begin{enumerate}
\item Characterization of many other types of "meta-data" -- building systems installed, age of building, zones, individual use types, etc. These are meta-data that could be extracted from building information models (BIM). 
\item Fine-tuned targeting of subsequences of performance data
\end{enumerate}
