\subsection{Predicting General Industry Membership}
\label{sec:predictinsiccode}

The first task that the features can be used for is to characterize the general industry for which a building is being used. We use the temporal features to predict various conventional features or about the accounts. As a proof-of-concept about this task, temporal data is used to build a classification model to predict the most common meta-data attribute of a building – its general use type. The one digit SIC classification is used in this preliminary step. The breakdown of these categories of the AMI data is found in Figure \ref{fig:buildingtypeclass}.

% Or if a KITT record doesn’t exist for the account, one can be self-populated using the most probable attributes from the prediction process. 



% The goal of this effort is to enhance the process of data integration between the raw temporal data and the characteristic meta-data.
