The remainder values of the \emph{STL} decomposition process are indicators of days that fall outside of the \emph{STL} model's prediction. This situation is similar to the residuals of the \emph{loadshape} models in Section \ref{sec:regressionmetrics}. Figure \ref{fig:remainder_single} illustrates an example of the residual days. Once again, this metric is normalized, however not on a 0 to 1 range. Instead, negative values indicate a lower than expected consumption for the day, while positive values are higher than average. In this example, the residuals aren't exceptionally systematic. However, a few identifiable days can be seen including Thanksgiving in November.
