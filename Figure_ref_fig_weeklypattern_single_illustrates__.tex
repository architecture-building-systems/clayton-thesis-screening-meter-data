Figure \ref{fig:weeklypattern_single} illustrates the weekly pattern decomposition for all of the case study buildings. For offices, most of the other cases also exhibit a typical Monday to Friday schedule, with a few exceptions that have various weekday differences and several that have higher values on Saturday. Tuesday seems to be the most consistent across the range of buildings as the peak day of consumption. University labs and classrooms appear to have the same amount of diversity and a similar schedule to offices, perhaps with slightly less consumption of Fridays. Primary/Secondary school classrooms appear to be the most consistent in their weekly Monday to Friday schedule and have a completely consistent lack of Saturday and Sunday utilization. University dormitories are the most diverse in their weekly patterns with approximately half of the buildings having dominant weekday schedules and half having dominant weekend schedules.
