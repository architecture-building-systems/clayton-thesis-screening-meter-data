Allocation of the primary use type of a building is often considered a trivial activity when analyzed from a smaller set of buildings. Discriminatory features have already been visualized extensively in Section \ref{sec:featureextraction} and the differences between the primary use types are apparent in the overview heat maps of each feature. In this and the following sections, a quantification of the impact of each feature will be evaluated by using the set to predict objectives.
