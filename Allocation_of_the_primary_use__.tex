Allocation of the primary use type of a building is often considered a trivial activity when analyzed from a smaller set of buildings. As the number of building being analyzed grows, so does the complexity of space use evaluation. The use of buildings changes over time and these changes are not always documented. In several of the case studies, this topic was discussed and highlighted as an issue with respect to benchmarking a building.\\

Discriminatory features have already been visualized extensively in Section \ref{sec:featureextraction} and the differences between the primary use types are apparent in the overview heat maps of each feature. In this and the following sections, a quantification of the impact of each feature will be evaluated by using the set to predict objectives.
