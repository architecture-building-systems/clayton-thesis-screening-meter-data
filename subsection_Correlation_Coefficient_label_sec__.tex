\subsubsection{Correlation Coefficient}
\label{sec:weathercorrelationcoeff}

A rough approximation of correlation can be extracted using the Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient. It is used to determine whether the meters are correlated with outdoor air drybulb temperatures. This aspect informs on how likely it is that a building is using electricity for either heating or cooling and, potentially, how envelope vs. internally load-dominated a building might be. The following example of three meters shows how the Spearman coefficient is interpreted. When a point has a value close to +1, it is highly cooling sensitive, close to 0 and it is weather insensitive, and close to -1 it is heating sensitive.
