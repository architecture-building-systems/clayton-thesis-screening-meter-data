\subsection{Predicting General Industry Membership}
\label{sec:predictinsiccode}

The first task that the features are used for is to characterize the general industry for which a building is being used. This task is a first step in using temporal features to predict necessary conventional features that can be used for more conventional targeting processes. As a proof-of-concept about this task, temporal data is used to build a classification model to predict the most common meta-data attribute of a building: its general use type. In this case, the label for use type is the Standard Industrial Class (SIC) one digit classification is used. The breakdown of the number of buildings within each of the SIC code categories is found in Figure \ref{fig:buildingtypeclass}.

% Or if a KITT record doesnâ€™t exist for the account, one can be self-populated using the most probable attributes from the prediction process. 



% The goal of this effort is to enhance the process of data integration between the raw temporal data and the characteristic meta-data.
