Figure \ref{fig:decisiontree} shows the same diagram zoomed in on a certain subsection of a cluster that contains mostly buildings that identify as \emph{classrooms}. Interspersed amongst these classrooms are several buildings labeled as \emph{offices}. These offices can be potentially thought of as \emph{misfits} in that they are not members of more consistently homogeneous clusters. Discussions with members of the case study groups revealed that this information is \emph{interesting}, but immediately there wasn't a clear understanding of how this information would influence decision-making. It was suggested that this information could be used to supplement the results of the benchmarking process by giving more insight into potentially \emph{why} a building is not performing well within its class. The situation may actually be that the building is more a member of a different class and therefore may not be comparable to those particular \emph{peers}.
