The specificity calculation process also implemented using input parameters designed to capture patterns of weekly behavior. In this situation, the input metrics of $a=6$, $p=14$, and $w=168$ are chosen to capture this behavior. These parameters settings model a 168 hour sliding window (one week) that is divided into 14 segments of 12 hours length, and the normalized magnitude assigns a symbol from a range of six letters, $a,b,c,d,e,f$. A single building example is seen in Figure \ref{fig:weeklyspecificity_single}. This building is also within the \emph{Office} use-type classification, thus the color spectrum indicates how specific each weekly subsequence is to this building's behavior as an office as compared to the entire training data set.
