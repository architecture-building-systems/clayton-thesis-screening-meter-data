\subsection{Principal Building Use}
\label{sec:buildinguse}

The first scenario investigated is the characterization of primary building use type. The goal of this effort is to quantify what temporal behavior \emph{is most characteristic in a building being used for a certain purpose}. For example, what makes the electrical consumption patterns of an office building unique as compared to other uses such as a convenience store, airport, or laboratory. This objective is important in order to understand who are the \emph{peers} of a building. Whatever category a building is assigned determines what benchmark is used to determine the performance level of a building. The EnergyStar Portfolio Manager is the most common benchmarking platform in the United States and the first step in its evaluation is identifying the property type. There are 80 \emph{property types} in portfolio manager and each one is devoted to a certain primary building use type. Twenty-one of those property types are available for submission to achieve a 1-100 ENERGYSTAR score in the United States. These property types are seen in Table
