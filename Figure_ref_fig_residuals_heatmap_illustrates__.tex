Figure \ref{fig:residuals_heatmap} illustrates the residuals applied across all of the case study buildings. Some similarity between all of the university offices, labs, and classrooms are apparent in terms of the holidays detected. The most consistent ones include the American memorial day in May, American Independence Day in July, Thanksgiving in November and Christmas Day in December. However, university Labs have a slightly less dramatic range of values. Primary/Secondary schools have appear to have many more dramatic differences from the \emph{STL} model.
