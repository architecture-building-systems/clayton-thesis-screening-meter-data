Figure \ref{fig:weeklyspecificity_all} illustrates weekly specificity as applied to all the buildings. The transition between specific and non-specific patterns is smoother in this case due to the weekly time range. It is also apparent that the most specific behavior patterns for each building use type is correlated to when that particular building has behavior related to lower occupancy such as summer breaks or holiday periods. These phenomenon need to be somewhat consistent across all the buildings within a classification in order for it to indicate specificity.
