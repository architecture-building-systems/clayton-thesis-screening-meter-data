\subsection{Site Visits for Case Studies}
\label{sec:sitevisit}
Throughout the course of two years, from February 2014 to April 2016, several site visits were conducted to interview operations staff at seven campuses. The purpose of this effort was two-fold: first, to collect as much raw, temporal data from each site as possible and, second, to discuss the status quo of building energy analysis as performed on their campus. This section discusses these site visits, the types of data that were collected, and a few of the lessons-learned from the process. A consistent theme in the site visits was that each campus has been investing in electrical metering and data acquisition systems over the past decade. In every one of the case study interviews, the operations staff discussed the underutilization of the data being collected. A common phrase was, "We have more meter data than any time before, and we're don't know what to do with it." Another common situation was that a campus had a large electrical metering infrastructure but did not know how to extract raw data for the purposes of this research project. This scenario occurred on three of the seven campuses after the first interview, and data was still not available even after a follow-up visit on two of those campuses. Therefore, only four of the seven case studies had data available and will be discussed in the following subsections.
%The methodology followed in this effort was drawn from mixed-method research techniques.
