\subsection{Site Visits for Case Studies}
\label{sec:sitevisit}
Throughout the course of two years, from February 2014 to April 2016, several site visits were conducted to interview operations staff at seven campuses. The purpose of this effort was two-fold: first, to collect as much raw, temporal data from each site as possible and, second, to discuss the status quo of building energy analysis as performed on their campus.
%The methodology followed in this effort was drawn from mixed-method research techniques.
