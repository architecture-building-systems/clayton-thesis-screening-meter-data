\subsection{Advanced Metering Infrastructure Case Study}
\label{sec:smartmeterdata}

A larger data set of almost 10,000 non-residential buildings is gathered in this thesis from an organization tasked with using the data to target buildings for performance improvement measures. These data are from an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) implementation. Different types of meta-data are available for these buildings, including industry and energy savings measure implementation.
