\subsection{Temporal Feature Extraction}
Modern, whole building electrical meters measure and report raw, sub-hourly, time-stamped data. Large amounts of intrinsic information can be extracted from temporal data to characterize a commercial building. The harvest of these information can assist in the implementation conventional analysis techniques. In order to extract information solely from these sensors, new features can be created from these raw data. These features are designated as temporal as they summarize behavior occurring in time-series data. To illustrate the concept of temporal features qualitatively, Figure X illustrates
