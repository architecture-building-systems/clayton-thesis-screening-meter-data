\subsubsection{High versus Low Consumption Comparison}
\label{sec:highvslow}

The two classifications chosen for this objective are intuitively the \emph{high} and \emph{low} consuming buildings. This part of the analysis gives a more in-depth perspective of exactly which features are most important in the differentiation between these two types of buildings. This understanding provides insight on potentially what behavior in a building results in good or poor performing buildings. Once again, the highly comparative time-series analysis (hctsa) code repository is used for this process. Figure \ref{fig:featurecluserting_performanceclass} is a correlation matrix showing the top forty features as determined by hctsa according t
