\subsubsection{Case Study #1} 
\label{sec:casestudy1}
The first case study is a campus in a continental climate in the United States. It is a university with 226 buildings spread across two main campuses. All together, these buildings have a total floor area over 2.3 million square meters (25 million square feet). An initial interview was conducted with the lead statistician of the facilities management in March 2015. Information was gathered on the building and energy management systems of the campus and a discussion regarding the typical utilization of the data was conducted. It was found that there are over 480 electrical meters on the campus and that these data were primarily used for billing of the individual academic departments.
