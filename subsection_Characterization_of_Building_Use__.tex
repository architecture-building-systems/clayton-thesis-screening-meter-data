The process of creation and visualization of temporal features is insightful on its own. However, it is necessary to further utilize the features with a specific objective to understand and validate their potential. 

Visualization of temporal features on their own is a means of understanding the range of values of various phenomenon across a time range. This situation gives an analyst the basis to begin understanding what discriminates a building based on various objectives. The next step is to utilize the features to predict whether a building falls within a certain category. This objective is done using classification.
