\section{Characterization of Building Use, Performance, and Operations}
\label{sec:characterization}

Visualization of temporal features on their own is a means of understanding the range of values of various phenomenon across a time range. This situation gives an analyst the basis to begin understanding what discriminates a building based on various objectives. The next step is to utilize the features to predict whether a building falls within a certain category and test the importance of various features in making that prediction. In this section, three classification objectives are tested: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Principle Building Use - the primary use of the building is designated by the principal activity conducted by percentage of space designated to that activity. It is 
\item Performance Class
\item General Operation Strategy
\end{enumerate}

For each objective, a Random Forest classification model is built using the features outlined in Section \ref{sec:featureextraction}.
