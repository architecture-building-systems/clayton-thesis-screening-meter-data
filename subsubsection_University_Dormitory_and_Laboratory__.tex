\subsubsection{University Dormitory and Laboratory Comparison}
\label{sec:dormvslab}

The random forest classification model and variable importance metrics provide an indication of how the features characterize the a building's use. A deeper investigation of the features with a comparison between two use types is useful to understand the characterization potential of various subsets of features. For this example, two building type classifications are compared that showed strong distinction from each other in the random forest model: university laboratories and dormitories. For this comparison we use the Figure\ref{fig:featurecluserting_dormvslabs} illustrates
