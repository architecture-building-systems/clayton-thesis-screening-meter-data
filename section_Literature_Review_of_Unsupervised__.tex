\section{Literature Review of Unsupervised Feature Extraction}

Researchers from several domains have developed methods of extracting insight from raw, unlabeled data from the built environment. Often these methods fall into the category of unsupervised statistical learning. Methods from this sub-domain of machine learning are advantageous due to their ability to characterize measured or simulated performance data quickly with less analyst intervention, metadata, and ground truth labeled data.
