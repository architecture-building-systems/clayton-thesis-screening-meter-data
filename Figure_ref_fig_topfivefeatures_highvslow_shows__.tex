Figure \ref{fig:topfivefeatures_highvslow} shows the probability distributions of the top five performing features in predicting high versus low consumption. The number one top feature for differentiating between these classes is the daily in-class similarity feature called \emph{BG_jmotif_inclasssim_24_6_6} that is generated by the \emph{jmotif} process. This feature informs us that buildings from all classes that have the highest daily pattern similarity to their peers are often also amongst the highest consuming buildings in their class. Buildings that are less similar in their daily patterns to their class are often in a lower percentile of consumption. This fact suggests that many buildings that are misclassified are lower consumers of electricity. The
