The baseline model correctly predicts the labels with a 18.1\% accuracy, while the features influenced models were 38.5\% for Non-Temporal, 45.3\% for the Temporal and 45.7\% for the combined model.  The baseline model represents common practice in which a class is chosen based on the probability distribution of that class occurring in the labeled dataset. The combined feature set more than doubles the probability of predicting this piece of meta-data.

We can also see in detail how the model predicts the classes for each by creating and analyzing a classification confusion matrix. Figure \ref{fig:confusionmatrix} illustrates this matrix for the combined model. We can observe that two of the largest classes, Retail and Finance, have the highest accuracy rates at over 55-60\% with several other categories being misclassified within them.  This issue is common with imbalanced classification models and further feature development would improve the model by better characterizing the difference between each class.
