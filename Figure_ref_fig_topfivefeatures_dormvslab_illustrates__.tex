Figure \ref{fig:topfivefeatures_dormvslab} illustrates the probability distributions of the top five differentiating features for distinguishing laboratories from dormitories. The probability density of each of the features is relatively similar in shape and distribution. This situation is due to the fact that most of the features are from clusters seven and eight which are highly correlated within the cluster and between the clusters as well.
