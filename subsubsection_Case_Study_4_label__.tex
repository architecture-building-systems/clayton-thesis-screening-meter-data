The final case study to be outlined in this section is a university campus located in Switzerland. This campus includes 22 building encompassing more than 150,000 square meters (1.6 million square feet). This campus has an energy management system with the ability to extract raw data, albeit only one point at a time. Data from this campus was utilized in a previous research project focused on campus and building-scale co-simulation and modeling.
