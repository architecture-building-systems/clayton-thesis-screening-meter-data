The specificity calculation process is implemented on each of the building test data sets. A single building example of this process is seen in Figure \ref{fig:dailyspecificity_single}. This building is within the \emph{Office} use-type classification, thus the color spectrum indicates how specific each subsequence is to this building's behavior as an office as compared to the entire training data set. This example is using the input metrics of $a=8$, $p=8$, and $w=24$ to capture the specificity of daily patterns. These parameters settings include the use of a 24 hour sliding window that is divided into eight segments of three hours length, and the normalized magnitude assigns a symbol from a range of eight letters, $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h$.
