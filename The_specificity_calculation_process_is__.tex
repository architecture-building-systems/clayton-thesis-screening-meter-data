The specificity calculation process is implemented on each of the building test data sets. A single building example of this process is seen in Figure \ref{fig:dailyspecificity_single}. This building is within the \emph{Office} use-type classification, thus the color spectrum indicates how specific each subsequence is to this building's class as an office.
