Figure \ref{fig:trend_heatmap} illustrates the trend decomposition as applied to the entire case study set of buildings. Offices appear to have quite a bit of diversity over time, with a few observable systematic low spots in the spring and autumn periods at the bottom of the heatmap. Laboratories reflect that behavior, while university visually have a opposite effect with lower than average trend in the summer months. Primary/Secondary school classrooms have a very distinct delineation between when school is in session and out of session during the summer and various breaks. As many of these schools are in the UK, their out-of-session periods appear to line up naturally. University dormitories also have clear delineations between occupied and unoccupied periods and they seem to also match up quite well, despite the diversity of data sources of these buildings.
