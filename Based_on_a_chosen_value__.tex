Based on a chosen value of $W$ segments and alphabet size $A$, each $N$ size window is transformed into a SAX \emph{word}. An example of this process is seen in Figure~\ref{fig:SAXWord}. This example shows two daily profiles which are converted to the SAX words, \emph{acba} and \emph{abba}. The SAX word is useful from an interpretation point of view in that each letter corresponds consistently to a subsequence of data from the daily profile. For example, the first letter explains the relative performance for the hours of midnight to 6:00 AM. Therefore if the size of $A$ is set to 3, a SAX word whose first letter is $a$ would have low, $b$ would indicate average, and $c$ would correspond to high consumption. Larger sizes of $A$ would create SAX words with a more diverse range of characters and would capture more resolution magnitude-wise.
