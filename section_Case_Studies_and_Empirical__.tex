\section{Case Studies and Empirical Data Collection}
\label{sec:casestudies}

One of the primary goals of this research is the testing and implementation of the temporal feature extraction techniques on empirical sensor data. Various raw data sets were collected from case study buildings and campuses around the world to test the developed methods. Several of these data sets were collected through a series of site visits and interviews. These interactions are detailed in Section \ref{sec:sitevisit}. Several other raw data sets were collected from open data sources on the Internet and were included in this study, albeit often with less meta data available. This section give an in-depth overview of these case studies by discussing the current performance data acquisition systems and the common methods of utilizing those data for everyday tracking activities.
