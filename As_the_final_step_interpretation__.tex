As the final step, interpretation and visualization are important for \emph{DayFilter} in order for a human analyst to visually extract knowledge from the results, and to make decisions regarding further analysis. We utilize insight from the \emph{Overview, zoom and filter, details-on-demand} approach \cite{Shneiderman:1996jt} and the previously mentioned VizTree tool \cite{Lin:2004wv}. The hidden structures of building performance data is revealed through the SAX process and we use visualization to communicate this structure to an analyst. The process uses a modified sankey diagram to visualize the augmented suffix tree in a way which the count frequency of each SAX word can be distinguished.  Figure~\ref{fig:saxdiscordsankeyheatmap} shows how this visualization is combined with a heatmap of the daily profiles associated with each of the SAX words using the same two-week example data from Figures \ref{fig:saxcreation} and \ref{fig:saxdiscordsankey}. The sankey diagram is rearranged according to the frequency threshold set to distinguish between the motif and discord candidates.
