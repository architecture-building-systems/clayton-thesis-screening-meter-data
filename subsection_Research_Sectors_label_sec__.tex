\subsection{Research Sectors}
\label{sec:subsectors}

Figure \ref{fig:yearbreakdown} illustrates the breakdown of publications based on the year published since 2005. They are further divided into four broad research domains: building energy analysis, building simulation, computer science and electrical engineering. These research field categories were subjectively determined for each paper through evaluating a combination of which university department the authors were from and in which publication the study was published. Building energy analysis pertains to researchers who predominantly focus on measured data analysis from buildings while simulation experts research forward modeling and simulation of building and urban systems. Both fields of study most often exist within architecture or mechanical engineering departments. Electrical engineering and computer science are two well-established domains and exist in their own departments. It is noticed that there is a gradual increase in the number of publications over the last ten years with electrical engineering and building energy analysis being the most common in the first few years and computer science and building simulation picking up since 2008.
