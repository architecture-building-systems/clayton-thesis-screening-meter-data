\subsection{Objectives}
The objectives of this thesis are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consolidate and curate a set of unsupervised features from various research domains that automatically extract characteristic information from raw temporal data
\item Extend these feature sets to include pattern recognition approaches that capture more information through characterizing usage patterns
\item Deploy these features on a test data set of 507 buildings to quantify the ability to characterize building use type, in-class performance, and operations types
\item Deploy a subset of features on a data set of 10,000 buildings to test the ability to predict whether an energy-savings measure implementation will be a success 
\end{enumerate}
