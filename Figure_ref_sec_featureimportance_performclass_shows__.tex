Figure \ref{sec:featureimportance_performclass} shows the variable importance calculation as it relates to classification for all three classes. The top features for this model are a mix of statistical features and model-based features. Within the statistical features category, the seasonal range for both winter and summer are top features in addition to several daily ratios. For model-based features, the loadshape model errors, the \emph{stl} model residuals, and the eemeter residuals are all present.
