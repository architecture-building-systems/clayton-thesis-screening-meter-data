\subsection{Load shape regression-based Features}
\label{sec:regressionmetrics}

Prediction of electrical loads based on their shape and trends over time is a mature field developed to forecast consumption to detect anomalies and analyze the impact of demand response and efficiency measures. The most common technique in this category is the use of heating and cooling degree days to normalize monthly consumption
