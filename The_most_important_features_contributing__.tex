The most important features contributing to the accuracy of the classification model are found in Figure \ref{sec:featureimportance_usetype}. These features are ranked according their importance in designating the difference between all of the building types. Three of the top fifteen most important features are from the \emph{stl} decomposition process. This fact shows the importance that normalized weekly patterns play in differentiation, especially for dormitories. Eight of the fifteen are statistical metrics, either ratios or consumption statistics. The second highest variable importance is related to the correlation output from the loadshape model. And the remaining three variables pertain to the number of long-term breakouts, and thus, volatility.
