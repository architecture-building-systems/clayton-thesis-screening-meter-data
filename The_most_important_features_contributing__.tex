The most important features contributing to the accuracy of the classification model are found in Figure \ref{sec:featureimportance_usetype}. These features are ranked according their importance in designating the difference between all of the building types. Three of the top fifteen most important features are from the \emph{stl} decomposition process. This fact shows the importance that normalized weekly patterns play in differentiation, especially for dormitories. Eight of the fifteen are statistical metrics, either ratios or consumption statistics.
