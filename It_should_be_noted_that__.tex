It should be noted that we do not normalize the individual subsequences, $N$, independently. This particular decision is divergent from the generalized shape-based discord approaches and is due to the fact that, in this level of analysis and the context of building performance data,  we are interested in discovering interesting subsections based on both magnitude and shape.

The targeted benefits of using SAX in this scenario are that discretization uniformly reduces the dimensionality and creates sets of words from the daily data windows. This transformation allows the use of hashing, filtering, and clustering techniques that are commonly used to manipulate strings \cite{lin_experiencing_2007}.
