Figure \ref{fig:campusperformance} illustrates another graphic related to building consumption classes that was discussed with case study participants. This graphic is an overview of the distributions of the simplified set of features for a certain campus as compared to the entire set of case study buildings. This graphic shows where the buildings on this campus stand as compared to their peers. In this case, the buildings are on the higher end of the normalized consumption, which could likely be due to the fact that they're also almost all in the highest 20\% of buildings for heating energy consumption. The buildings also have a relatively high load diversity, thus the base loads for this campus are likely higher than average and interventions could be designed to reduce this unoccupied load. Many of the case study participants saw this insight as useful as it \emph{supplements} the information from benchmarking.
