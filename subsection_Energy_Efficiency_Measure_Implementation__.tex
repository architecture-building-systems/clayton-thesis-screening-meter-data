\subsection{Energy Efficiency Measure Implementation Success Prediction}
\label{sec:measuresuccess}

The next example of using the temporal features is predicting the success of future measure implementation events using the past data. For this proof-of-concept, we took the Pre and Post-measure implementation data from close to 1,600 accounts that had one or more measures implemented between Oct. 2013 and Oct. 2014. We calculated the difference in mean daily consumption before an after the measure implementation to achieve a rough indication of measure success. We then divided the measures into three classifications according to where the difference in daily consumption for each account fits in the range of values. The accounts in the lowest 33\% were considered “Poor”, while the 66\% percentile were “Average” and the top 33\% are considered “Good”. Simple difference in mean daily consumption is not a perfect metric for success, as it is not normalized for weather or occupancy changes; although it is adequate for this step as we are already arbitrarily choosing the thresholds for class difference anyway and we are looking for a simple metric at this point. We recognize that improvement of this success metric is an obvious improvement in the methodology that can be pursued going forward.
