Decision trees often over-fit data on their own due to high variance. Random forest models work by creating a set of decision trees and averaging all of their predictions to overcome this variance. Figure \ref{fig:tree_ensemble} illustrates a set of four decision trees that is more accurately able to distinguish between the two classes than a single tree model.
