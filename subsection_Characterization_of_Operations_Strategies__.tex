\subsection{Characterization of Operations Strategies}
\label{sec:operations_strategies}

The final characterization objective for the case studies is the ability for the temporal features to classify buildings from the same campus, and thus building that are being operated in similar ways. This characterization takes to into account the similarity in occupancy schedules, patterns of use, and other factors related to how a building operates. This type of classification is more important in understanding the features that contribute to the differentiation, rather than the classification itself.
