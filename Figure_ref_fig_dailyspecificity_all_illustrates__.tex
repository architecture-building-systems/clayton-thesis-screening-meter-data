Figure \ref{fig:dailyspecificity_all} illustrates this process applied to all 507 case studies as divided amongst the use types. Clear differences in patterns across the time ranges are visible for each of the building use types. Offices, university laboratories, and university classrooms all seem to have similar phases of specificity in similar times of year, while dorms and primary/secondary schools are often differentiated by their breaks.
