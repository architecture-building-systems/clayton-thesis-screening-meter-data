\subsection{Temporal Feature Extraction}
Modern whole building electrical meters store raw, sub-hourly, time-stamped data. In order to extract information solely from these sensors, new features can be created from these raw data.  These features are designated as temporal as they summarize behavior occurring in the high-frequency, time-series data. Figure \ref{fig:temporalfeatures} illustrates the categories of temporal features created in this effort.
