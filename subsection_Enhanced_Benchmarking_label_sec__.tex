\section{Enhanced Benchmarking}
\label{sec:results_benchmarking}

The status quo of building performance benchmarking in the United States is the EnergyStar Rating system. This system relies on the Commerical Building Energy Consumption Survey that is completed every three years by the United States Department of Energy. In the United Kingdom, there is a mandatory building performance rating system requiring building owners to have Display Energy Certificates (DEC).

Using the insight gained through characterization of building use type, it is possible to inform whether a building's behavior matches its peers.

For example, a building owner may realize from EnergyStar that their building is bad, it received a rating of X.
