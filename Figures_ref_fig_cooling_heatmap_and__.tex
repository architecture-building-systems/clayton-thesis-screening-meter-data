Figures \ref{fig:cooling_heatmap} and \ref{fig:heating_heatmap} illustrate heating and cooling energy regression for all case study buildings. Each building's response to outdoor air temperature is indicative of the type of systems installed in addition to the efficiency of energy conversion of those systems.
