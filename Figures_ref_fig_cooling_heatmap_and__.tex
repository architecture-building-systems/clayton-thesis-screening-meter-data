Figures \ref{fig:cooling_heatmap} and \ref{fig:heating_heatmap} illustrate heating and cooling energy regression for all case study buildings. These figures have been normalized according to floor area. Each building's response to outdoor air temperature is indicative of the type of systems installed in addition to the efficiency of energy conversion of those systems. Approximately 15-20\% of offices, labs, and classrooms have a certain amount of cooling electrical consumption, while the rest have little to none. Many of those buildings are on district heating and cooling systems therefore weather dependent electrical consumption is likely due to air distribution systems or auxiliary pumps. Several of the labs have year-round cooling consumption, likely due to climate and the high internal loads that accompany laboratory environments.
