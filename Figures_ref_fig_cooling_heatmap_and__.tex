Figures \ref{fig:cooling_heatmap} and \ref{fig:heating_heatmap} illustrate heating and cooling energy regression for all case study buildings. These figures have been normalized according to floor area. Each building's response to outdoor air temperature is indicative of the type of systems installed in addition to the efficiency of energy conversion of those systems. Approximately 15-20\% of offices, labs, and classrooms have a certain amount of cooling electrical consumption, while the rest have little to none. Much
