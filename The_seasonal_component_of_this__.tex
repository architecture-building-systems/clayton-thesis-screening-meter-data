The seasonal component of this decomposition process can then be extracted to get an understanding of the typical weekly pattern of a building's electrical consumption. Figure \ref{fig:weeklypattern_single} illustrates this situation for a single building that has a typical office-style utilization schedule with a Monday to Friday working schedule with Saturday and Sunday off. This metric has been normalized in order to make it comparable to other buildings.
