These results are interpreted as a latent need for techniques that take into consideration the people, process, and philosophy aspects of the performance analysis equation \cite{Miller:2013vk}. These studies highlight the need to extract information with less known meta-data about each building and fewer inputs into the process.


\subsection{Objectives}
The objectives of this thesis are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consolidate and curate a set of unsupervised features from various research domains that automatically extract characteristic information from raw temporal data
\item Extend these feature sets to include pattern recognition approaches that capture more information through characterizing usage patterns
\item Deploy these features on a test data set of over 1200 buildings to quantify the ability to characterize building use type, in-class performance, and measure implementation success
\item 
\end{enumerate}
