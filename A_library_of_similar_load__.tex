A library of similar load ratio daily metrics are developed and implemented on the case study buildings. These other ratios are daily mean versus maximum, minimum versus 95\% percentile, and mean versus 95\% percentile. The use of the 95\% metric is mean to mitigate against outliers skewing the load ratios. These ratios are calculated on all days in the set, as well as just for weekend and weekdays. A full list of the features generated are found in Appendix A.
