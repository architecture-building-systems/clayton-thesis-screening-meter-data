\subsection{Overview of Publications}
\label{overviewofpubs}

This section is a review of the literatures that began through a selection of unsupervised analytics categories outlined by authoritative sources from the machine learning community \citep{hastie_elements_2009,james_introduction_2013,duda_pattern_2012,mirkin_clustering:_2012}. The categories selected are clustering, novelty detection, motif and discord detection, and rule extraction. The field of visual analytics was added to these groups to cover the presentation layer of many of these types of techniques. An initial search of publications was then selected for inclusion through a Google Scholar search of the combination of the method categories and the terms ``building energy'', ``building performance analysis'', and ``building energy analysis''. From this initial list of publications, a set of application categories and sub-categories was developed as seen in Figure \ref{fig:categoriespie}. A more detailed search of each application class was then completed to account for the unique analytics techniques used in those domains. Only publications with a majority of the focus on utilization of unsupervised techniques and with a focus only on non-residential buildings are reviewed. Only works completed since 2005 are included to discuss only the most contemporary work and due to the relatively recent development of most of the techniques examined. A cutoff date of April 1, 2016, is applied for inclusions of publications in this section.
