Augmented suffix tree of SAX words. Each level from left to right represents the $W1-W4$, the substrings are noted adjacent to each bar, and the bar thickness is proportional to the number of days within each pattern type. The pattern frequency in number of days is noted in this graphic within or just adjacent to each bar. \cite{miller_automated_2015}
