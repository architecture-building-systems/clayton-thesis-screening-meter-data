Overview of SAX-VSM algorithm: first, labeled time series are converted into bags of words using SAX; secondly, $tfâˆ—idf$ statistics is computed resulting in a single weight vector per training class. For classification, an unlabeled time series is converted into a term frequency vector and assigned a label of a weight vector which yields a maximal cosine similarity value (figure and caption used with permission from \cite{senin_sax-vsm:_2013}).
