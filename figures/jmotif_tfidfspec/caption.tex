An example of the heat map-like visualization of subsequence \emph{importance} to a class identification. Color value of each point was obtained by combining $tfâˆ—idf$ weights of all patterns which cover the point. The highlighted class specificity corresponds to a sudden rise, a plateau, and a sudden drop in Cylinder; to a gradual increase in Bell; and to a sudden rise followed by a gradual decline in Funnel (figure and caption used with permission from \cite{senin_sax-vsm:_2013})
