\subsection{Temporal Feature Extraction}
Many modern buildings have a whole building electrical meter that is automatically storing raw, sub-hourly, time-stamped data. In order to extract information solely from these sensors, new features must be created from these raw data.  These features are designated as temporal as they summarize behavior occurring in the high-frequency, time-series data. Figure \ref{fig:temporalfeatures} illustrates the categories of temporal features created in this effort.
