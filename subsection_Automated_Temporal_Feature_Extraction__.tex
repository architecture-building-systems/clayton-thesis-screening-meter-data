\subsection{Automated Temporal Feature Extraction}

In order to We draw inspiration from other time-series analysis and visualization applications in order to address the progression of data mining in the building industry. One emerging trend is that "data mining algorithms should have as few parameters as possible, ideally none. A parameter-free algorithm prevents us from imposing our prejudices and presumptions on the problem at hand and let the data itself speak to us \cite{Keogh:2004vp}." This approach is known as \emph{parameter-free} or \emph{parameter-light} data mining. The efficacy of these algorithms has been proven comparable or better than many more complex, traditional time-series data mining approaches \cite{Keogh:2004vp}.
