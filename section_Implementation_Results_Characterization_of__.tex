\section{Implementation Results: Characterization of Building Use Type}
\label{sec:results_usetype}

The process of creation and visualization of temporal features is insightful on its own. However, it is necessary to further utilize the techniques presented in other contexts to understand and validate their potential. The first scenario discussed is the characterization of primary building use type. The primary goal of this effort is to characterize what behavior \emph{causes a building to operate due to the way in which occupants are using it}. For example, what makes the electrical consumption patterns of an office building unique as compared to other uses such as a convenience store, airport, or laboratory.
