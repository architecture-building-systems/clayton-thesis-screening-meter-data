The goal of temporal feature extraction and analysis is to use various techniques to convert all these \emph{qualitative} terms into a \emph{quantitative} domain. For example, the descriptor \emph{weather-dependency} can be quantified through the use of the spearman rank order correlation coefficient with outdoor air temperature. Consistency or volatility of daily, weekly, or annual behavior can be quantified using various pattern recognition techniques. The primary focus of this study is to create and apply a number of temporal feature extraction techniques on commercial buildings for the purpose of characterization. Figure \ref{fig:temporalfeatures} illustrates the categories of temporal features created in this effort.
