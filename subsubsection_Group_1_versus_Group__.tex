\subsubsection{Group 1 versus Group 2 Comparison}
\label{sec:group1vsgroup2}

Groups 1 and 2 were selected to undertake a deeper analysis using the highly comparative time-series analysis library. Figure \ref{fig:featurecluserting_operationsgroups} shows the top forty features and their correlated clusters. The first and largest cluster of features in this case are from the breakout detection process, a calculation of long-term volatility. This insight suggests that breakouts are a key discriminatory aspect of seasonal patterns that would exist for buildings being operated in the same way. The third cluster includes a diverse set of features including a few from the loadshape library and several statistics-based metrics. The fourth cluster contains mostly
