\section{Scalability}
\label{sec:results_measures}

This project has created additional information about AMI accounts by extracting characteristics from the high-frequency time-series AMI measurements. Based on a classification test using almost 9,600 labeled smart meter accounts, we improved the accuracy of predicting building type (based on SIC 1-Digit category) by over 27\% over a conventional baseline. 

We then aggregated data about measures implementation from the KITT database and classified almost 1,600 accounts into Good, Average, and Poor performing classes according to pre and post-measure consumption. A classification model was developed using the KITT and AMI information that improved the ability to predict measure implementation class success by 18\% over a baseline. Additionally, there was only a 20\% error rate in differentiating between Good and Poor performing measures.

The biggest opportunity ahead is to apply the generated models to the 30,000+ unlabeled SMB AMI accounts to help characterize missing meta-data and predict measure implementation success for future projects. Much work is also yet to be done to improve the models and input information to bring the overall prediction accuracies higher in absolute terms. Model prediction can also be improved incrementally as the AMI and KITT Databases grow and better data integration is achieved. A promising area in prediction accuracy is in the use of better daily and weekly pattern recognition techniques.
