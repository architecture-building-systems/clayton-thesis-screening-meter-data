\subsection{Screening large amounts of field data for value}
\label{sec:screeningdata}

One emerging trend is that "data mining algorithms should have as few parameters as possible, ideally none. A parameter-free algorithm prevents us from imposing our prejudices and presumptions on the problem at hand and let the data itself speak to us \cite{Keogh_2004}." This approach is known as \emph{parameter-free} or \emph{parameter-light} data mining. The efficacy of these algorithms has been proven comparable or better than many more complex, traditional time-series data mining approaches \cite{Keogh_2004}. This mantra is a primary objective of the feature extraction process outlined in this study.
