\subsubsection{Selection of Case Study Subset for Feature Implementation}
\label{casestudysubset}

A subset of buildings was chosen based on limiting criteria for inclusion in the implementation sections of this thesis. These criteria include data completeness, detection of outliers, and detection of unreasonable flat-lined data.

Each of the target buildings is standardized by replacement of its original identifier, whether it be the building name or address, with a randomly generated human name \footnote{This process was done by through a random word generator in Python: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RandomWords/0.1.5}. This process is done to mask the true identity of the building, while still providing a means of identification.
