Four classification models were then created to predict the general SIC Category of each account:
\begin{itemize}
\item Baseline model - using the distributions of the input samples to guess the category
\item Non-Temporal Features Model – using the old non-temporal features containing monthly data and zip code/location information
\item Temporal Features – using the new features generated from the AMI data
\item Combined Features – using all the features, temporal and non-temporal
\end{itemize}

Random forests model were implemented using Python’s SK-Learn library. The models were executed an out-of-bag error to calculate mean model accuracy of a multi-label classification. Figure \ref{fig:modelimprovement_ami} illustrates the results of the models with respect to percent mean accuracy improvement over the baseline.
