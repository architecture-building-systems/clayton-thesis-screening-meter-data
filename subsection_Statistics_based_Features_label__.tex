\subsection{Statistics-based Features}
\label{sec:statisticsfeatures}

The first set of temporal features to be extracted are basic statistics-based metrics that utilize the time-series data vector for various time ranges to extract information using mean, median, maximum, minimum, range, variance, and standard deviation. If a time-seies vector is described as $X$, with $N$ values of $X = {x_1, x_2,...,x_n}$, the most common statistical metric, mean (or $\mu$), can be calculated using Equation \ref{eq:mean}.

\begin{equation}
\mu = \frac{\sum\limits{i=1}^N x_i}{N}
\label{eq:mean}
\end{equation}
