The baseline model with this data is able to predict the success within this set of classification at 32.8\% accuracy, while the model based on temporal features achieved 51.1\% accuracy. The more important aspect to pay attention to is that the misclassification rate between “Good” and “Poor” is less than 20\% -- a promising fact that motivates further investigation using the existing temporal data-set.
