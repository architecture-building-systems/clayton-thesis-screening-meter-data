Figure \ref{fig:breakout_heatmap} illustrates breakout detection across the building use types in this study. This implementation uses the same input parameter of a 30 day minimum between breakouts. One notices somewhat of a consistency amongst offices, labs, and classrooms in terms of the distribution of breakout numbers, while university dormitories and primary/secondary classrooms have a noticeably higher number of breakouts across the range of behavior.
