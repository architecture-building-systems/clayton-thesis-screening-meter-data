Figure \ref{sec:labsvsdorms_nullhypth} shows a distribution of the library of features on the data set compared to a benchmark of nulls generated by randomly selecting the class. This visualization shows that there is a clear statistical difference in discriminating these two classes for a large number of the input features. The real mean is approximately 62\%, while the null mean is slightly above 50\%.
