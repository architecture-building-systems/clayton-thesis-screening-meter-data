Figure \ref{sec:highvslow_nullhypth} shows the probability distribution of the features in their ability to distinguish between high and low consumption as compared to a baseline. The mean of the created features is approximately 58\%, while the null mean is 51\%. This situation indicates that the generated temporal features have a significant impact in the prediction and evaluation of whether a building performs well or not.
