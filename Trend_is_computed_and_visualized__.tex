General trend over the course of the year of data is another example of quantifying the seasonal patterns in utilization of a building. Weather influence has been reduced or removed using the change point models. Therefore, a trend could be the result of changes in building occupancy due to breaks, changes in equipment or space functions that would significantly increase or decrease the consumption, or gradual faults in systems of equipment. Figure \ref{fig:trend_single} illustrates a single building example of a decomposed trend for a building. January to May are in the middle range of consumption trend with a noticeable dip in April. From June to Oct, there is a trend upwards of higher than normal consumption, perhaps due to higher utilization of the space. October to the end of the year are back to average with a slight dip during the last few weeks of the year.
