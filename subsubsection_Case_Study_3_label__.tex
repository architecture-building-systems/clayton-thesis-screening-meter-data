\subsubsection{Case Study \#3}
\label{sec:casestudy3}

The third case study is a campus in the Midwest region of the United States. Once again, it is a university campus with 25 buildings encompassing 204,000 square meters (2.2 million square feet) of floor space. An initial site survey and discussion of the campus was conducted in March 2015 with the campus lead mechanical and energy engineers. This campus has its electrical meters connected to a campus energy management platform that includes various visualizations and analytics techniques. This platform also has the ability to easily provide raw data download for analysis in this study. This platform resulted in this campus being by far the most user-friendly with respect to data collection out of the case study set, including the open, on-line data sources. Raw data in flat files was easily downloaded for all data points at once. The meta-data for this campus was also extracted from this energy management platform, albeit in a more manual method from the user interface. A follow-up visit to this campus was conducted in March 2016 with initial results of characterizing the data according to a subset of the tested features. A significant amount of feedback for this case study was given by the facilities management department regarding ability for these insights to assist in their decision-making processes.
