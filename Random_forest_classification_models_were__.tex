Random forest classification models were chosen based on their ability to model diverse and large data sets in a robust way \cite{Breiman}. These models use an ensemble of decision trees to predict various characteristic labels about each building based on the its features. The literature describes decision trees as the "closest to meeting the requirements for serving as an off-the-shelf procedure for data mining" \cite{hastie_elements_2009}. Figure \ref{fig:decisiontree} illustrates an example of a decision tree using features to determine whether a patient is sick or healthy using two features \cite{Geurts_2009}.
